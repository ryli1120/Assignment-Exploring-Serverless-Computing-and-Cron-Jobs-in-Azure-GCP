Exploring Serverless Computing and Cron Jobs in Azure, GCP
Assignment: Exploring Serverless Computing and Cron Jobs in Azure, GCP, and GitHub
Objective
The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to serverless computing and the use of cron jobs in cloud environments. You will deploy serverless functions on both Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and create a scheduled task using GitHub Actions.

Instructions
1. Deploy a Serverless Function
Azure:
Navigate to the Azure portal and create an Azure Function.
Choose a simple trigger (e.g., HTTP trigger) and deploy a basic function (e.g., "Hello, World").
GCP:
Access the Google Cloud Console and create a Google Cloud Function.
Deploy a similar function with an HTTP trigger in GCP.
2. Create a Cron Job
GitHub Actions:
Create a new GitHub repository (or use an existing one).
Set up a GitHub Action workflow that runs a script on a schedule (e.g., daily at midnight). You can use a simple script that logs "Scheduled task executed" to the console.
3. Explore Functions as a Service (FaaS)
Reflect on the use cases for serverless functions in cloud environments. Consider the benefits and limitations of using Functions as a Service (FaaS) in both Azure and GCP.
4. Submit Your Work
Create a Markdown document that includes:
Screenshots of the serverless function deployment process in both Azure and GCP.
The code and configuration of your GitHub Action workflow.
Screenshots or documentation of the GCP Cloud Scheduler setup.
A brief reflection on the use cases, benefits, and limitations of serverless functions.
Commit and push this Markdown document, along with the screenshots and code, to your GitHub repository.
Deliverables
A Markdown document in a GitHub repository called HHA504_assignment_functions that includes:
Screenshots of the serverless function deployments.
Code and configuration for the GitHub cron job.
Documentation of the GCP Cloud Scheduler setup.
Reflection on serverless computing.
